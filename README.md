# Data-Scientist-Path

The list of courses I completed and plan to take in order to hone my Data Science skills.
This will be divided in 2 categories :
Statistics and Computer Science. 

I said statistics and not mathematics because I do have a separate repo where there are all the mathematics
classes I took.

The CS are mainly about programming, algorithms and databases as they are (in my opinion) the most important skills
for a Data Scientist.
