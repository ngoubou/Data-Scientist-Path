# Data-Scientist-Path

The list of courses I completed and plan to take in order to hone my Data Science skills.
This will be divided in 3 categories :
Statistics, Computer Science and Business. 

I said statistics and not mathematics because I do have a separate repo where there are all the mathematics
classes I took.

The CS are mainly about programming, algorithms and databases as they are (in my opinion) the most important skills
for a Data Scientist.

I added Business cause it's often an overlooked component, but yet important, of the Data Scientist skillset.

The technical skills acquired are only valuable if they have a business application.
So having an understanding of the business landscape is very important.
